## Installation

### Developer Setup

**Requirements:** Node.js v20+ and basic terminal knowledge

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aagentah/nw_wrld.git
cd nw_wrld

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the app
npm start
```

Two windows will open:

- **Dashboard**: Control center for configuration and mapping
- **Projector**: Visual output window

---

**The rest of this guide assumes you're running from source.**

---

## Step 0: Choose Your Project Folder

When you first launch nw_wrld, you'll see a dialog:

**"Select a project folder"**

You have two options:

1. **Create a new folder** - For a fresh project
2. **Choose an existing folder** - To continue a previous project or use an empty folder

### What Happens Next

nw_wrld will initialize your project folder with:

- **16 starter modules** - Ready-to-use examples (Text, GridOverlay, SpinningCube, etc.)
- **Sample assets** - Images and JSON data files for experimentation
- **Data storage** - Configuration, tracks, and recordings

**Note:** Workspace modules are JavaScript code executed by nw_wrld. Only open project folders you trust.

Your project folder structure will look like this:

```
MyProject/
├── modules/           # Visual modules (16 starter modules included)
├── assets/            # Images and JSON data
│   ├── images/
│   └── json/
└── nw_wrld_data/      # App data (auto-managed)
```

### If Your Project Folder Goes Missing

If your project folder is deleted, moved, or disconnected (e.g., external drive unplugged), nw_wrld will detect the issue and prompt you to:

- **Reselect** the folder if you know where it moved
- **Choose a different project** to continue working

---

## Step 1: Create a Track

1. In the Dashboard, click **[CREATE TRACK]**
2. Name your track (e.g., "My First Track")
3. Click **[CREATE]**

Tracks are containers for visual modules and sequencer patterns.

---

## Step 2: Add a Visual Module

1. Click **[+ MODULE]**
2. Select a module from the dropdown (e.g., **Text**, **GridOverlay**, **Corners**)
3. Configure the module's initial properties if prompted

**What are modules?** Modules are visual elements displayed in the Projector window. Your project includes 16 starter modules covering 2D graphics, 3D visuals, text, and data visualization.

---

## Step 3: Add Channels

1. Click **[+ CHANNEL]** to add a channel to your track
2. Channels appear as rows with a 16-step sequencer grid
3. Add multiple channels to trigger different methods or create complex patterns

**What are channels?** Each channel controls one or more methods on your modules. Channels are your rhythmic triggers.

---

## Step 4: Program Your Pattern

1. Click cells in the sequencer grid to activate steps (cells turn red when active)
2. Each row is a channel, each column is a beat (16 beats total)
3. Create rhythmic patterns by activating different steps

**Tip:** Start simple - try activating steps 1, 5, 9, and 13 for a basic quarter-note rhythm.

---

## Step 5: Assign Methods to Channels

1. Click on a channel row to select it
2. Click **[ADD METHOD]** in the right panel
3. Select a method (e.g., `color`, `scale`, `rotate`, `show`)
4. Configure method parameters in the modal
5. Click **[SAVE]**

**What are methods?** Methods are actions you can trigger on modules. Built-in methods include `show`, `hide`, `scale`, `rotate`, `opacity`, and more. Each module can also define custom methods.

When the sequencer playhead hits an active cell, it triggers that channel's assigned methods.

---

## Step 6: Play Your Pattern

1. Click the **[PLAY]** button in the footer
2. Watch the playhead move across the 16-step grid
3. See your visuals respond to the pattern in the Projector window
4. Adjust BPM in Settings (60-130 BPM)

The pattern loops continuously until you click **[STOP]**.

**Congratulations!** You've created your first audiovisual composition with nw_wrld.

---

## Editing Modules

One of nw_wrld's most powerful features is that you can edit modules and see changes instantly.

### Finding Your Modules

1. Navigate to your project folder (the one you selected on first launch)
2. Open the `modules/` directory
3. You'll see all 16 starter modules as `.js` files

### Editing Modules

**Option 1: Use Your Favorite Text Editor**

1. Open any `.js` file in your preferred editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, etc.)
2. Make changes to the code
3. Save the file
4. nw_wrld automatically detects the change and reloads the module

**Option 2: Use the Built-in Editor (Optional)**

1. In Dashboard, go to Settings → Module Editor
2. Select a module to edit
3. Make changes in the Monaco editor
4. Save → hot reload applies automatically

### What You Can Change

- **Colors, sizes, positions** - Modify default values
- **Animations** - Add or change animation behavior
- **Methods** - Create new triggerable methods
- **Visual style** - Completely change how modules render

### Example: Changing Text Color

Open `modules/Text.js` in your project folder and find the color option:

```javascript
{
  name: "color",
  defaultVal: "#FFFFFF",  // Change this to "#00FF00" for green
  type: "color",
}
```

Save the file and the module reloads automatically.

### Learning from Examples

Study the 16 starter modules to learn different patterns:

- **HelloWorld.js** - Simplest possible module
- **Text.js** - DOM-based text rendering
- **GridOverlay.js** - Canvas drawing
- **SpinningCube.js** - Basic Three.js 3D
- **AsteroidGraph.js** - Loading workspace assets

See the [Module Development Guide](MODULE_DEVELOPMENT.md) for complete documentation.

## Working with Assets

Your project folder includes an `assets/` directory for images, JSON data, and other resources.

### Asset Folder Structure

```
MyProject/
└── assets/
    ├── images/
    │   └── blueprint.png    # Included starter image
    └── json/
        └── meteor.json       # Included starter dataset
```

### Adding Your Own Assets

1. Navigate to your project folder
2. Add files to `assets/images/` or `assets/json/`
3. Reference them in your modules using the SDK

### Loading Assets in Modules

Use docblock-declared imports to load project assets:

```javascript
/*
@nwWrld name: Asset Demo
@nwWrld category: 2D
@nwWrld imports: ModuleBase, assetUrl, loadJson
*/

class AssetDemo extends ModuleBase {
  async init() {
    const imageUrl = assetUrl("images/your-image.png");
    const data = await loadJson("json/your-data.json");
    // use imageUrl/data...
  }
}

export default AssetDemo;
```

### Example: Using the Image Module

The included **Image** module demonstrates asset loading:

1. Add a track and add the **Image** module
2. The module loads `images/blueprint.png` by default
3. Add your own images to `assets/images/`
4. Edit the `path` parameter to load your image

## Advanced: Connect External MIDI/OSC

Once you're comfortable with the sequencer, you can connect external hardware for live performance.

### Prerequisites

- A DAW that can send MIDI (Ableton Live, FL Studio, Logic Pro, etc.)
- MIDI routing software:
  - **Mac**: IAC Driver (built-in)
  - **Windows**: loopMIDI

### Setup MIDI Routing

**Mac:** Open Audio MIDI Setup → Show MIDI Studio → Enable IAC Driver

**Windows:** Download and install [loopMIDI](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html)

**DAW:** Enable your virtual MIDI port for Track/Remote output in Preferences

### Switch to External Mode

1. Open Dashboard → **Settings**
2. **Signal Source** → Select **External (MIDI/OSC)**
3. Configure your MIDI device or OSC port
4. Go to **Settings → Configure Mappings** to customize trigger mappings (MIDI pitch classes / OSC addresses)
5. Your DAW now controls the visuals in real-time

### DAW Notes (Channel 1 Defaults + Best Practice)

Many DAWs send note events on **MIDI Channel 1** by default. nw_wrld lets you choose which MIDI channel controls track selection and which controls method/channel triggers:

- **Simplest setup (one channel)**:

  - Set both **Track Select MIDI Channel** and **Method Triggers MIDI Channel** to `1`.
  - Use **Settings → Configure Mappings** to choose which pitch classes (C..B) activate track selection vs method triggers.

- **Clean separation (two channels)**:
  - Route track selection notes to Channel 1 and trigger notes to Channel 2 in your DAW.
  - Set **Track Select MIDI Channel** = `1` and **Method Triggers MIDI Channel** = `2` in nw_wrld.

## Troubleshooting

### Project Folder Issues

**"Project folder missing" message:**

- Your project folder was deleted, moved, or disconnected
- Click **Select Different Project** to choose or create a new project
- If you know where it moved, navigate to it and select it again

### Module Issues

**Module doesn't appear in dropdown:**

- Check that the file is saved in your project's `modules/` folder
- Verify the file has `export default ClassName` at the end
- Check the console for syntax errors
- Verify the file starts with a docblock that includes `@nwWrld name`, `@nwWrld category`, and `@nwWrld imports`

**Module appears but won't load:**

- Open Developer Console (Cmd+Option+I on Mac) in the Projector window
- Check for JavaScript errors
- Verify your `@nwWrld imports` includes everything you use (e.g. `ModuleBase`, `assetUrl`, `loadJson`, `THREE`, `p5`, `d3`)
- Check that all required methods are defined

**Changes not reloading:**

- Verify the file is saved
- Check that you're editing the file in your project's `modules/` folder (not the app's source)
- Close and reopen the file to ensure it saved

### Asset Issues

**Assets won't load:**

- Verify files are in your project's `assets/` folder
- Check that paths are relative: `images/file.png`, not `/images/file.png`
- Verify file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Check the console for errors

### Sequencer Issues

**Pattern not triggering visuals:**

- Verify methods are assigned to channels (click channel → Add Method)
- Check that cells are activated in the grid (should be red)
- Verify the module is visible (trigger `show` method or set `executeOnLoad: true`)
- Check the console for errors

**Module not visible after adding:**

- Add a channel and assign the `show` method
- Or edit the module to set `executeOnLoad: true` on a method that calls `this.show()`

### Development Mode Issues

**App won't start (development setup):**

- Close other dev servers using port 9000
- Run `npm install` again
- Check Node.js version: `node --version` (should be v20+)
