# Session Log

## Date: 2026-01-16

### Accomplished
- **Installation:** Successfully ran 'npm install' to install project dependencies.
- **Git Configuration:** Configured local git user to 'tlcdv' and email to 'zae@todosloscobardesdelvalle.com'.
- **Planning:** Analyzed 'instructions.md' and established a workflow for implementing the visual styles.

### Observations
- **Module Location:** Found 'CloudPointIceberg.js' in 'src/main/starter_modules/', not 'src/project/modules/' as implied by instructions. This likely means they need to be instantiated or copied.

### Next Steps
- **External Setup:** User needs to set up the DAW and Virtual MIDI bridge.
- **Module Customization:** Modify modules to react to MIDI signals.
- **Run Application:** Start with 'npm start'.
